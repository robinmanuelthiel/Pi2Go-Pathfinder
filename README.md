# Pi2Go Pathfinder
A Python script for the beatuiful [Pi2Go project](http://4tronix.co.uk/store/index.php?rt=product/product&product_id=400), that guides the robot along a path on the floor, unitl it finds an obstacle, where it turns around intil it finds the line again and follows it back.

## Yeah, but why?
This script has been created for fun during the [mgm hackathon #01: Raspberry Pi Robot](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/mgm-hackathon/events/228590829/) in Munich at April, 5th 2016.
